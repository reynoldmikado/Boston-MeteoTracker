The Boston MeteoTracker is a shiny application that investigates, explores, analyses and presents findings about various weather metrics in Boston spanning 2013 to 2023 across the four seasons. These points of analysis, designated Index, surfeit results with different charts like bar graphs, wind rose diagrams, box plots, violin plots, line graphs, scatter plots, five-point statistical summaries, and data tables. Ultimately, these analysis points and their accompanying results could furnish industries, businesses, and individuals with insights to avert undesirable outcomes.

The introductory interface reveals three tabs:
- About: A summary of the application's purpose and functionality.
- Key Insights: A motley of inferences from the analysis points.
- Welcome to Boston: A peek into the beautiful city of Boston.
For each selected index, the user is presented with bespoke sub-menu to customise their query.

A successful query will reveal a clearly developed graph, a filtered data table displaying the underlying data, and five-point summary of the selected weather metric. There is also a description tab for each index that succinctly delineates its function.

In a nutshell, it is an educational tool and useful guide into the last 11 years of Boston's weather history.
I hope you enjoy using this app. Cheers!
