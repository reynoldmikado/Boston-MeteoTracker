<p><strong>Metric Overview:</strong> This summarises the weather metrics listed above. It typically presents statistical summaries (mean, median, quartiles, distributions, maximum and minimum values, etc.) and visualisations that help understand the overall climate trends in Boston over the observed period.</p>
    <p><strong>Time Series:</strong> Focuses on the chronological sequence of weather data points collected over time. This analysis helps observe patterns, trends, and seasonal variations in weather metrics such as temperature and precipitation, facilitating predictions and deeper insights into climatic changes.</p>
    <p><strong>Annual Average:</strong> Calculates and displays the average values of each weather metric for each year. This helps compare year-to-year changes and understand long-term trends, making spotting unusual weather patterns or significant climatic shifts easier.</p>
    <p><strong>Daily Seasonal Trend:</strong> Examines the day-to-day weather changes within each season, providing insights into daily variability. This can help understand daily weather patterns and their implications on local activities or ecosystems during different seasons.</p>
    <p><strong>Annual Seasonal Trend:</strong> This analysis tracks how different weather metrics behave across different seasons every year. It highlights how seasonal weather patterns evolve year over year, useful for studies related to climate change and seasonal forecasting.</p>
    <p><strong>Metric Correlation:</strong> Explores the relationships and dependencies between different weather metrics, such as how temperature might correlate with humidity or air pressure. Understanding these correlations can aid in more complex climatological studies and improve forecasting models.</p>
    <p><strong>Wind Analysis:</strong> Dedicated to studying wind patterns, including speed and direction. This analysis is crucial for understanding over time, which can impact various sectors such as agriculture, energy, and even urban planning, especially in wind-prone areas.</p>
