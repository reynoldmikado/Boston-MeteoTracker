    <h4>Temperature Stability with Minor Fluctuations</h4>
    <p>Graphs show consistent temperatures with slight yearly variations. This predictability can be used in strategic planning, particularly tourism, to promote Boston as a destination with stable weather, appealing to travellers seeking reliability.</p>
    
    <h4>Seasonal and Annual Precipitation Variability</h4>
    <p>There are significant seasonal and annual variations in precipitation. Enhancing water management to balance surpluses and deficits is crucial. This can be achieved by boosting reservoir capacity, bolstering conservation, and advancing irrigation efficiency.</p>

    <h4>Economic Impact of Weather Patterns</h4>
    <p>Temperature highs and low precipitation significantly affect energy, agriculture, and insurance sectors. Energy companies can adjust their capacities based on temperature trends, farmers can optimise crop cycles with predicted rainfall, and insurers can revise premiums and policies to manage flood and drought risks better.</p>

    <h4>Predictable Air Pressure</h4>
    <p>Air pressure is relatively stable, suggesting fewer disturbances such as storms. This stability is a potential selling point for hosting outdoor events and activities, as stable air pressure often correlates with good weather conditions. It also allows for more reliable scheduling in sectors like aviation and shipping.</p>

    <h4>Tourism Adaptation to Seasonal Variability</h4>
    <p>While temperature remains stable, the significant variations in precipitation could impact tourism activities heavily dependent on weather conditions, such as outdoor sports and recreational tourism. Tourism boards and businesses can develop seasonal packages that benefit from the expected weather conditions. For instance, promoting indoor attractions and cultural events during the wetter months and outdoor activities during drier periods can help maintain tourist inflow throughout the year.</p>

    <h4>Renewable Energy Planning</h4>
    <p>The temperature and air pressure predictability can be leveraged to optimise renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. Energy companies can use these predictable patterns to forecast energy production from renewable sources accurately. For instance, stable temperatures and consistent sunlight exposure can enhance the efficiency of solar panels. Conversely, predictable wind patterns during certain times of the year can optimise wind turbine operations.</p>
